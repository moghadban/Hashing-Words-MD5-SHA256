	Hashing Words with Python
	Description:  This Python script will take in a list of words, compute their MD5 and SHA256 hash values, return two dictionaries, and will execute the word along its corresponding hashes.
	A module to calculate the MD5 and SHA256 values of a list of words will be named calcHashFunc, and the main function will prompt user for words to be hashed, once input is received,
	the word list is passed to calcHashFunc. The returned dictionaries are to be printed out in this function.
	Usage: python.exe Hashing-Words-with-Python.py
